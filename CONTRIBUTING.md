   git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature
   ```

## Development Workflow

### Running the Project

  npm run dev # Runs the library and the examples website in watch mode
  ```
- Run tests:
  ```sh
  npm run test # Runs tests across all workspaces
  ```
- Build the library:
  ```sh
  npm run build # Builds the library and the exmaples website
  ```

### Code Guidelines
- Follow the existing code style and conventions.
- Ensure your changes pass ESLint, Prettier and TypeScript checks:
  ```sh
  npm run lint
  ```
- Keep PRs focused and provide clear descriptions.

## Submitting Changes
1. **Commit Your Changes**:
   ```sh
   git commit -m "feat: Add new feature"
   ```
   Note, that we use commitlint to enforce conventional commit messages.
2. **Ensure version and changelog**:
   If you made a user-visible change, add a new entry to the `CHANGELOG.md` file if necessary under "Unreleased" section.
3. **Push to Your Fork**:
   ```sh
   git push origin feature/my-new-feature
   ```
4. **Open a Pull Request**:
   - Go to the original repository.
   - Click "New Pull Request".
   - Select your branch and submit the PR with a clear description.
5. **Release**:
   When there is a need to release a new version of the library, repository maintainers should create a special commit and a tag, associated with the new version. A new version should be added to the `CHANGELOG.md` file and the version in `package.json` should be updated. The version should follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).
   To create a new release, run `Release` workflow in the GitHub Actions tab. This will create a new release and publish it to npm.
